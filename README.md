###  Fan Tales is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React](https://react.dev/) framework. React is a versatile JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling developers to create applications for the web, mobile, and even desktop platforms using a single codebase with the help of frameworks.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) built-in Eloquent ORM, which allows the app to define custom storage schemas and interact seamlessly with a database. Laravel supports various database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and SQL Server, enabling efficient and scalable data management.

- The app utilizes [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing media and other assets. S3 ensures secure, scalable, and durable storage, making it easy to manage and access large files such as images and documents.

- The website utilizes [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design, additionally it simplifies the development of the website and contributes into visually appealing interfaces.

- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is utilized for authentication and session management.
